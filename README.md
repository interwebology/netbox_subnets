# Pull All Subnets From NetBox API

This script just pulls all the subnets stored inside of NetBox. Run this through my BASH script
in the BASH script toolbox and get a list of pinging hosts that can be used to build a ansible hosts file

## How To Run 

Update the script with the Netbox API endpoint where it says ** <IP HERE> ** inside the prefix.py script
and run with **python3 prefix.py** to pull out all the subnets.
